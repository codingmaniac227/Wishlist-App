📚 Anime Book Wishlist 📚
Welcome to my DOM-based JavaScript project! This is a visually simple but functional wishlist app designed to track and organize your favorite anime-themed books. The project showcases core JavaScript skills, interactive UI features, and a clean HTML/CSS foundation — perfect for reinforcing the essentials of modern frontend development.

✨ Features
⚙️ Dynamic Wishlist Interaction
Displays a preset list of anime book titles such as Naruto and Dragon Ball.

Clicking on a book adds it to the wishlist, updating the interface in real-time using JavaScript.

🔄 DOM Manipulation in Action
Uses document.createElement(), appendChild(), and event listeners to:

Generate book list items.

Handle user interactions through click events.

Dynamically update the wishlist section.

🖱️ Event Handling
Users interact with elements via click events that trigger JavaScript functions.

Adds books to the wishlist without reloading the page, enhancing interactivity and responsiveness.

🧱 Key HTML Elements Used
✅ Semantic Tags
<h1> and <h2> for structured headings.

<div> elements used as containers for the book list and wishlist areas.

✅ External Files
<script src="script.js"> links to the interactive behavior logic.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> connects the page to its design.

🎨 Key CSS Elements Used
🎨 Styling Foundation
A soft background color (rgb(228, 191, 191)) provides a welcoming tone.

Basic styling used to separate sections and improve readability.

Future plans to enhance layout using Flexbox for responsiveness.

📘 Concepts Practiced
JavaScript Arrays: Used to manage and display book lists.

DOM APIs: Created and manipulated elements dynamically.

Event Listeners: Click-based interaction added using addEventListener.

Conditional Logic & Loops: Controlled flow of data and rendering.

Semantic HTML: Structured content for clarity and maintainability.

Styling with CSS: External styles for layout and design separation.

Version Control: Git used for commits and tracking changes.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Add feature to remove books from the wishlist.

Style the layout using Flexbox and media queries.

Integrate localStorage to save the wishlist between sessions.

Pull book data dynamically from a public API.

🪞 Reflection
This project demonstrates how powerful simple tools like arrays, events, and DOM manipulation can be in creating dynamic, interactive applications. It’s a practical step in designing and building responsive user experiences from scratch.
